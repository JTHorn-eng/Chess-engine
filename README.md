# ChessEngine

Implementation of a chess engine in Haskell.

# About
This script makes use of the minmax algorithm with an alpha beta pruning optimisation technique to efficiently output the best move a player can make. Currently a work in progress, my aim is to continuously update the heuristics of scoring states in the state space search and refine the code to make full use of Haskell's features.
